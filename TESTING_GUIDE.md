## üêõ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: Registration Form Not Showing Roles**
**Cause**: No roles exist in database
**Fix**: Create roles using admin panel or seeders

### **Issue: No Audits Available for Assignment**
**Cause**: No active audits in database
**Fix**: Create audits using admin panel

### **Issue: Audit Assignment Section Not Appearing**
**Cause**: JavaScript not loading
**Fix**: Check browser console for errors

### **Issue: 500 Error During Registration**
**Cause**: Missing role or audit validation
**Fix**: Check Laravel logs at `storage/logs/laravel.log`

## üîç **Database Verification**

### **Check User Creation:**
```sql
SELECT u.id, u.name, u.email, r.name as role_name 
FROM users u 
JOIN model_has_roles mhr ON u.id = mhr.model_id 
JOIN roles r ON mhr.role_id = r.id 
WHERE u.email = 'auditor@test.com';
```

### **Check Audit Assignment:**
```sql
SELECT u.name, a.name as audit_name, uaa.assigned_at 
FROM users u 
JOIN user_audit_assignments uaa ON u.id = uaa.user_id 
JOIN audits a ON uaa.audit_id = a.id 
WHERE u.email = 'auditor@test.com';
